Special Hessian structure allows its fast approximate construction and inversion with complexity comparable to that of gradient methods. The use of rational IIR restoration kernels provides a richer family of filters than the tradi- tionally used FIR kernels. Smoothed absolute value and the smoothed deadzone functions allow accurate and robust deconvolution of super- and sub-Gaussian sources, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the pro- posed methods.",
