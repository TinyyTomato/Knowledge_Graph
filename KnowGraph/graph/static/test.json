While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.","keywords":"['Point cloud', 'classification', 'segmentation']","year":"2019","url":"['http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829', 'db/journals/tog/tog38.html#WangSLSBS19', 'https://doi.org/10.1145/3326362', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3326362', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3326362', 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829', 'http://www.webofknowledge.com/']}}},

In this study, this problem was resolved by arranging point cloud data in a canonical space through a graph CNN. The proposed graph CNN works dynamically at each layer of the network and learns the global geometric features by capturing the neighbor information of the points. In addition, by using a squeeze-and-excitation module that recalibrates the information for each layer, we achieved a good trade-off between the performance and the computation cost, and a residual-type skip connection network was designed to train the deep models efficiently.

However, dynamic point clouds usually exhibit holes of missing data, mainly due to the fast motion, the limitation of acquisition techniques and complicated structure. Further, point clouds are defined on irregular non-Euclidean domain, which is challenging to address with conventional methods for regular data. Hence, leveraging on graph signal processing tools, we propose an efficient dynamic point cloud inpainting method, exploiting both the inter-frame coherence and the intra-frame self-similarity in 3D dynamic point clouds. Specifically, for each frame in a point cloud sequence, we first split it into cubes of fixed size as the processing unit, and treat cubes with holes inside as target cubes. Secondly, we take advantage of the intra-frame self-similarity in the target frame, by globally searching for the most similar cube to each target cube as the intra-source cube. Thirdly, we exploit the inter-frame coherence among every three consecutive frames, by searching the corresponding cubes in the previous and subsequent frames for each target cube as the inter-source cubes, which contains most nearest neighbors of the target cube in the relative location. Finally, we formulate dynamic point cloud inpainting as an optimization problem based on both intra- and inter-source cubes, which is regularized by the graph-signal smoothness prior. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms three competing methods significantly, both in objective and subjective quality.","keywords":"","year":"2019","url":"['db/journals/corr/corr1904.html#abs-1904-10795', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10795', 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10795']"}}},

However, they do not consider the spatial relationship within the local point sets. We propose a directed connected graph network (DCGN), which can effectively capture the spatial relationship of local point sets by constructing the directed connected graph (DCG). Specifically, in the feature learning stage, the connection directions from neighbor points to the center point are constructed for each local point set to learn the feature transferring weights from neighbor points to center point. In order to further model the spatial distribution of local point sets, we use a distance-weighted method to perform local feature fusion.

In this work, we derive a new architectural design that combines rotationally and topologically invariant graph diffusion operators and node-wise feature learning through (1times 1) convolutions. By combining multiple isotropic diffusion operations based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we can learn an optimal linear combination of diffusion kernels for effective feature propagation across nodes on an irregular graph.
